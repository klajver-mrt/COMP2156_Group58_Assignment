COMP 2156

This course is designed to help students learn the appropriate ways for people to set up collaboration software
such as GitHub to help with software development in our carreers. It will help students learn how to initialize
projects, push their work to a repository, pull down files from the repository, and how to merge branches. This
is important as it is how the industry works and will be the backbone of some of our jobs in the industry. We 
are also learning how to use different types of software to aid in this project such as travis, GitHub Actions,
Docker, etc..
