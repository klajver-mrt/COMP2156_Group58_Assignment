DevOps

DevOps is important because nobody works alone and having multiple people working on a common
goal using the right tools for the job (github, etc.). Having a way to colaborate and work together on
projects is important. This keeps things all in one place for a manager to keep track of who's doing what 
and what's getting done. It can also help people solve problems and troubleshoot as there are more than one
set of eyes on the problem.

The lifecycle: It spans from the beginning of software development through to delivery, maintenance, and 
security.
