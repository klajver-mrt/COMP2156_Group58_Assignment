George Brown

George Brown is an accredited college in Toronto, ON, Canada, Earth, Milky Way, Infinity. It has multiple 
campus locations throughout the city and offer many programs. The program I'm attending is T147 (Computer Systems
Technology). George brown has large class sizes and few TA's which makes it a litle more challanging for 
students. I'm in Zoom classes with 149 other students and there is nobody to watch the chat or answer questions.
But the teachers are all trying their best with what they've got. NetLab is a really cool product for us to learn
on but it is very complicated and has lots of moving parts, which means it is unreliable. The computers 
provided on campus are technically capable of completing your work without needing a computer of your own,
but homework might be an issue. 


George Brown College Casa Loma Campus has everything you need for success. To the Book Store, Tim Hortons,
the library, and many other things, you will find all you need to not fail.
